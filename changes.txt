Project 2 Changes - Jake Halloran

  For project 1, my website while technically functional and requirements fulfilling, was simply just
ugly, nonresponsive, and sort of pointless. This time around however, most all of that has done a complete
180 degree change. Through extensive use of the bootstrap template freelancer to handle portions of the CSS
I am terrible at I was able to make a site that actually lives up to my expectations of what proper web design
looks like. The inclusion of the ability to auto center elements and handle page resizing much nicer than my
attempts of margin: 0 auto; means that top to bottom the site looks and feels better. Other than just CSS changes,
this new and improved site makes proper use of PHP. For my first site, I technically had some PHP but all it
did was handle a contact form by writing the unmodified JSON object to disk with out even stripping the data
headers. This time around however, both a responsive search bar and a new iteration of my attempt at a contact
form utilize PHP data storage the correct way. Both the search and contact use ajax to post the data to a PHP
function that opens a connection to the database and creates the database and table if it doesn't exist and if
it does merely uses semantic PHP mysqli objects to perform all of the storage and loading operations. As far as
javascript and jquery goes, other than the addition of the necessary js files that happily come with bootstrap,
not much was changed. Frankly, my jquery was by far the most functional part of the site the first time around
and outside of a few changes to the ajax call and removal of functions operating on no longer existing objects,
my jquery remains remarkably intact despite the migration to a single page design. Finally, the sites content
is infinitely better than it was for project part 1. Unlike the first project where I had a few buttons that
showed tiny snippets of content and other pages to show a contact form and resume iFrame, I have now changed
everything to exist on a single page and therefore look much more complete. Additionally, the addition of the
interests search means that much more content about myself is immediately available than on my first site, thus
not only making the content look nicer but also deepening it.
