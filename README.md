# Jake Halloran CS 1520 Project 2
Single page powered by the foundation page for bootstrap with heavy modifications by me.
The Contact form and search relies on ajax and php therefore it was tested using XAMPP for windows
and the newest chrome build for which it works.

Notes:
  Pretty sure the php and CSS should be responsive everywhere, but wouldn't be too surprised if
  something like the contact form ends up running away on window resizing.
